    const message = `*By Your Mercy, Ya Kareem… grant us Jannah*

This heartfelt dua calls upon Allah ﷻ by His Names Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful) and Al-Kareem (The Most Generous), asking for easy entry into Jannatul Firdows Al A’la — the highest, most blessed level of Paradise reserved for the best believers and His Awliyah (Friends). It humbly seeks this blessing solely through His infinite mercy, without hardship in this life or the next.

For verily the mercy and generosity from Allah is the only means to attain such a noble station.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said:

 “Whoever hopes for Paradise, then let him die with faith in Allah and the Last Day.” (Muslim)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Rahman (O Most Merciful), Ya Kareem (O Most Generous), by Your infinite mercy and generosity, grant us easy entry into Jannahtul Firdows Al A’la, the highest and most blessed level of paradise, which is reserved for the best of the believers and Your Awliyah (Friends). Ya Allah, despite our shortcomings, we ask You to grant us this highest station in Jannah solely by Your boundless mercy and generosity, without the need for hardship, suffering, grief, or sadness, either in this life or the next. Let our entry be one of joy, relief, and eternal peace, where we experience the perfection of Your blessings and everlasting comfort, in the company of Your beloved Habeebullah, Sultan-ul-Anbiya, Rasulullah, Sayyidina Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, along with our family and loved ones.*
