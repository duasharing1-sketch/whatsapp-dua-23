    const message =  `*By Your Mercy, Ya Kareem… grant us Jannah*

This heartfelt dua calls upon Allah ﷻ by His Names Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful) and Al-Kareem (The Most Generous), asking for easy entry into Jannatul Firdows Al A’la — the highest, most blessed level of Paradise reserved for the best believers and His Awliyah (Friends). It humbly seeks this blessing solely through His infinite mercy, without hardship in this life or the next.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Rahman (O Most Merciful), Ya Kareem (O Most Generous), by Your infinite mercy and generosity, grant us easy entry into Jannahtul Firdows Al A’la, the highest and most blessed level of paradise, which is reserved for the best of the believers and Your Awliyah (Friends). Ya Allah, despite our shortcomings, we ask You to grant us this highest station in Jannah solely by Your boundless mercy and generosity, without the need for hardship, suffering, grief, or sadness, either in this life or the next. Let our entry be one of joy, relief, and eternal peace, where we experience the perfection of Your blessings and everlasting comfort, in the company of Your beloved Habeebullah, Sultan-ul-Anbiya, Rasulullah, Sayyidina Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, along with our family and loved ones.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
